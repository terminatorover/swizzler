swizzler
========

simple app that uses method swizzling and a coordinator singleton class to implement session expired functionality. namely, if the user doesn't touch the screen for X amount of time the app shows an alert and logs the user out and takes him/her to the login screen 
also, shows the user a local notifcaition if the user app is in the background and the has been timed out(eg. the bank of america app does this)
